        <h3>7/10 <a>- Talking Samuil</a></h3>
        <p>This is a really fun app your kids can enjoy. It has several mini-games and functions to keep your
            kid entertained. I, myself, have also played it for several minutes and I kinda liked it. My 9-year
            old boy is on the same opinion.</p>

        <h3>4.5/5 <a>- Humans vs. Robots</a></h3>
        <p>Humans vs. Robots is a really good modern-day shooter. It has a wide range of weapons, from real-life
            guns to futuristic guns or a literal lightsaber. The multiplayer experience is awesome - the
            progression of the game is fair, no microtransactions - only skill. The singleplayer campaign is
            also good, but i prefer playing multiplayer with friends.</p>

            <h3>19/20 <a>- Humans vs. Robots</a></h3>
            <p>Quiero señalar que Humans vs Zombies es una experiencia fantástica. Toda la creatividad detrás de la
                creación del juego es asombrosa: muchos de los aspectos del juego se sienten como algo del mundo
                real y de un universo de ciencia ficción. Como si pudiera explotar torres en Barcelona con solo
                pulsar un botón. </p>

            <h3>3/4 <a>- Clicker</a></h3>
            <p>You really can't predict what mini-game you're about to play. There's over 20 mini-games with so much
                modifiers. The combinations are a lot. In fact, there's a chance you never ever managed to play one of
                the combinations. But you have to be extremely unlucky for that. Oh, and Online races are fun.</p>

            <p>Before I played this game, I had a small we we, no girlfriend and no will to live. None of these have
                changed but the game is still pretty fun.</p>

            <p>Better than Ubisoft's Watch Dogs. You guys actually finish your games, unlike them. </p>
