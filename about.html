    Troll Games is an indie games developer but make no mistake.
           Our games don't fall short of a triple A game.

    Gogo Manev is our lead developer.
    He has made games since he was 1
    year old and hasn't stopped. He
    was the genius mind behind such
    classics as Watch dogs and clicker.
    Gogo is the one who managed to make 
    the clicker game just a single bite.
    He has no intention of stopping
    anytime soon!

    Samuil Sharkov is the animator. 
    His talent exceeds everyone's
    expectations. He once made an
    animation so smooth that the 
    computer exploded trying to
    process it. It's thanks to Samuil 
    that Troll Games have such a beutiful
    scenery for the players to explore.

    Teodor Kamchev is the one responsible
    for our music. It gives a special flare
    to our games that just pulls you in the 
    world. Once a person was reported missing
    because he played one of our games. Later
    it was found out that the music was a bit
    like that of the pied piper and lured 
    people. We promise that won't happen 
    again!
