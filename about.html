            Troll Games is an AA games developer but make no mistake.
            Our games don't fall short of a triple A game.

            <p>Gogo Manev is our lead developer.
                He has made games since he was 1
                year old and hasn't stopped. He
                was the genius mind behind such
                classics as Watch dogs and clicker.
                Gogo is the one who managed to make
                the clicker game just a single bite.
                He has no intention of stopping
                anytime soon!

            <p>Samuil Sharkov is the animator.
                His talent exceeds everyone's
                expectations. He once made an
                animation so smooth that the
                computer exploded trying to
                process it. It's thanks to Samuil
                that Troll Games have such a beutiful
                scenery for the players to explore.

                Teodor Kamchev is the one responsible
                for our music. It gives a special flare
                to our games that just pulls you in the
                world. Once a person was reported missing
                because he played one of our games. Later
                it was found out that the music was a bit
                like that of the pied piper and lured
                people. We promise that won't happen again!
